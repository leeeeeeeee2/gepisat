Requirements
============

This code was successfully compiled and executed using Python 2.7 interpreters
(Python Software Foundation, 2017).

This code requires the installation of third-party packages: NumPy (v.1.11.3 by
NumPy Developers, 2016) and SciPy (v.0.18.1 by SciPy Developers, 2016).

The GePiSaT database is developed using postgreSQL (v.9.5 by The PostgreSQL
Global Development Group, 2017) and utilizes the third-party Python package
psycopg2 (v.2.6.2 by Federico Di Gregorio and Daniele Varrazzo, 2014).


Contents
========

database/
    Python package containing class definitions and utilities for creating GePiSaT database input files.

gepisat/
    Python package containing class definitions and utilities for the GePiSaT model.

db_setup.py
    Provides tools for managing the GePiSaT database tables (i.e., create and
    drop table) and populating them (i.e., loading data to the database).
    Libraries:
        - gepisat.db_util

table_maker.py
    Converts observations (e.g., FLUXNET, WATCH, CRU TS) to a format that can
    be read into the GePiSaT database.

model.py
    Main module for running the GePiSaT model.
    * Acquires monthly half-hourly PPFD and NEE observation pairs.
    * Performs GPP and Re partitioning of NEE and PPFD based on models defined
      by Ruimy et al. (1995).
    * Removes outliers in PPFD:NEE observations based on model fitting using
      Peirce's criterion (Peirce 1852; Gould 1855).
    * Outputs original and outlier-free monthly datasets with fit parameters:
        > [STATION]_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt, original
        > [STATION]_[YYYY-MM-DD]_ro.txt, outlier-free
    * Outputs partitioning statistics to file:
        > summary_statistics.txt
    * Selects the best model parameters for modeling based on: model fitness
      and parameter significance.
    * Acquires WFDEI shortwave radiation grid measurements based on flux tower
      location and day of the year.
    * Calculates extraterrestrial solar radiation (in units of PPFD) based on
      the SPLASH model methods (Davis et al., 2017).
    * Gap-fills daily PPFD observations with scaled extraterrestrial solar
      radiation flux.
    * Outputs observations and gap-filled time series:
        > [STATION]-GF_[YYYY-MM-DD].txt
    * Calculates half-hourly GPP based on partitioning results.
    * Integrates half-hourly to monthly gap-filled PPFD and GPP.
