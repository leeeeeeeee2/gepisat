%% PART 3.1 -- PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT
%% //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// %%
\section{Environment Setup}
\label{sec:mes}
The core of the modeling is performed using open-source programming languages (e.g., Python and R). 
In order to facilitate the model, specific configurations were made to the working environments which these programs operate under.  
These configurations often accompany having specific library files installed within the working environment that the model is executed under.  
This section overviews the necessary working environment configurations to operate the model code described in this reference.

\subsection{Python environment}
\label{sec:mespy}
The most efficient method of quickly gaining access to all the necessary Python libraries and modules (except psycopg2) is to download an interactive development environment (IDE).  
Two notable Python IDEs are the Enthought Python Distribution\footnotemark \footnotetext{https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/} (now called ``Canopy'') and Google spyder$^{2}$\footnotemark \footnotetext{http://code.google.com/p/spyderlib/} (previously called ``Pydee'').  
Both Canopy and spyder provide a comprehensive Python developing and programming environment for scientific analysis and visualization.  
There is a free version of Canopy as well as a free one-year academic license for registered users with a school or university e-mail address. 
Spyder is open-source software available for Windows, Mac OSX, and Linux operating systems.  
Table \ref{tab:pylib} presents a list of Python libraries that are used in this model and the model files in which they are used.

Due to lack of compatibility with Canopy IDE and the psycopg2 module and the complexity of installing the HDF4 libraries (for reading the MODIS EVI data) on a native installation of Python, a combination of Python environments are used in this model.  
To process the data, table\textunderscore maker.py is run from Canopy.  
To create the database tables, populate them with the data and to run the model, the native Python environment (with numpy, scipy, and psycopg2 libraries installed) is used.

%% PART 3.1.2 -- PROGRAMMING ENVIRONMENT: R
%% //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////// %%
\subsection{R environment}
\label{sec:mesre}
Similar to the Python, the R programming language benefits from having an open source IDE for programming and development.  
One such IDE is RStudio\footnotemark. \footnotetext{http://www.rstudio.com/ide/}
